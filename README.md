# todo-list-kata

We will practice this kata: the ToDo list [1].

In our version, we will create a ToDo list manager.

It will be created in an incremental fashion:

• First deliverable: CLI version, in-memory storage

• Second: add tags, categories, projects. add file persistence

• Third: add multiple system users, add persistence to the cloud

• Fourth: add multi-device sync (including conflict resolution)
